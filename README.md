# Mern-booksearch

This application is a book search engine using a google api. this was a fully functioning react app but I made it run with graphql and apollo server.
When you load the application you can search books by name and author. The application already saves past searches. the user also can login/signup.
when logged in the user can save a book they like and add it to a list. below is a demo gif of the application.
